# InstacartCustomerBehaviour-
Used Python to derive Insights of customer shopping  behavior and preferences
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has outstanding sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I used python to derive insights and offer methods for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Key Questions

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
